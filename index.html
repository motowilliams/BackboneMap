					<strong>About:</strong>It’s 1991. Tim O’Leary, a third generation Montanan was living
					in Colorado, finding his way working for NOAA, mountain biking and skiing… and feeling
					a little bit like a fish out of water. Colorado is a beautiful state, but Montana
					was home. One afternoon on his bike ride home, he spotted a new business that had
					cropped up in Boulder. It was a Brew on Premise (BOP) – a place where customers
					could come in and brew their own beer. Having dabbled in homebrewing for a few years,
					he tried it and thought, “This is my ticket back home.” Fast forward to 1995. Tim
					and his wife, Suzy Rizza, open Missoula’s first BOP. Lots of people came to try
					it, and lots of people had a great time doing it. It wasn’t quite making the bills
					though, and for the next 13 years, through good times and worse times - Tim was
					the guiding force behind the transformation of the Kettlehouse into a small microbrewery
					and neighborhood taproom.</p>
